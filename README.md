# QGAN-Unidirectional-Photonics
LaSt-QGAN is a hybrid quantum-classical model for inverse design of all-dielectric metasurfaces achieving angle-robust unidirectional transmission. Using a VAE-QGAN architecture, it enables 40Ã— data efficiency, 95% solar-cell gain, and real-material mapping for scalable, manufacturable quantum-enhanced photonics.
