# QGAN Unidirectional Photonics

**Quantum-Enhanced Inverse Design of Angle-Robust Metasurfaces**

LaSt-QGAN (Latent-Space Quantum Generative Adversarial Network) is a **hybrid quantum-classical architecture** for inverse design of all-dielectric metasurfaces that achieve **unidirectional, angle-independent light transmission** for advanced photovoltaic applications.

## 🌞 Overview

Metasurface-enabled photovoltaics offer powerful ways to control light—enhancing trapping, spectral shaping, and directionality. However, achieving **stable unidirectional transmission independent of incidence angle** has been a major challenge.

LaSt-QGAN bridges this gap by combining a **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** with a **Quantum GAN (QGAN)** to directly generate metasurface patterns from desired far-field profiles. This approach drastically reduces data requirements and computational cost while maintaining optical accuracy and manufacturability.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Unidirectional Transmission:** Robust across −60° to 60° incidence angles  
- **Data Efficiency:** Achieves results with only 500 training samples (40× fewer than classical GANs)  
- **Fast Training:** ~2.5 hours on a single Tesla A100 GPU  
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architecture:** Combines VAE encoding with quantum generator circuits  
- **Real-Material Mapping:** Integrates refractive index database for manufacturable designs (<10⁻⁴ MSE)  
- **Performance Gain:** 95% boost in simulated Perovskite solar-cell efficiency

## 🧠 Architecture


The **VAE** compresses high dimensional metasurface image into low dimensional latent space. The **QGAN** generator explores this space using quantum circuits to produce candidate metasurface geometries that satisfy far-field design targets. A **classical discriminator** refines convergence, ensuring physical realizability.
